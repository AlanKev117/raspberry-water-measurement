# Water Level Measurement with Raspberry Pi

This project is meant to use a Raspberry Pi (model Zero W+ up to 4B) to help measure water level in a water tank placed on the roof of a house.

## Prerequirements

### Set up your Raspberry Pi (OS, user, network and ssh access, if you wish)
- Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite/Full (32-bit) in a microSD card.
- You can follow a [headless configuration](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#setting-up-a-headless-raspberry-pi) or use the [advanced menu](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#advanced-options) in the Raspberry Pi Imager tool to setup the user, network, and ssh.

### Enable I2C communication in your Pi

Run `sudo raspi-config` and enable I2C using the menu.
